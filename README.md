## Contributing
If you would like to contribute, please check this simple rules:
* Keep It Simple Stupid  
 This tool should need as few dependencies as possible. The aim is not to rebuild the wheel, but to be a little more ascetic. Take it as a Groovy challenge.
* Please fork and introduce new changes by pull-requests
* There is not much in place, including no linter. If we come to the point, please introduce yourself, but keep the first rule in mind.
